Use-case: Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning on Entangled Data Sets

Problem: Machine learning models often require large amounts of sensitive data from multiple sources, which may exist on different blockchain networks.

Solution: ZKMips can enable privacy-preserving machine learning on entangled rollups. Model training and inference occur off-chain using MIPS assembly, with results verified across multiple chains without revealing the underlying data or model parameters.

Example: A cross-border healthcare AI system could be trained on sensitive patient data from multiple countries, each with its own blockchain. Using ZKMips within an entangled rollup, the model's predictions could be verified across all participating chains without exposing individual patient information or violating data sovereignty laws.
